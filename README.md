# BUNNDAO 🌎 

A dAPP for BlockchainUNN created in partial fulfillment of the requirements to be a certified BlockchainUNN web3 developer. 

BUNN-DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that aims to create a community-driven platform for funding and support social impact projects in UNN tech space. 🙌 

It is powered by Ethereum (currenty sepolia test net), Solidity, React, nextJS, 

  

## What is a DAO? 🤔  

A DAO is a member-owned community without centralized leadership that is governed by computer code. DAOs use blockchain technology to provide a secure and transparent ledger to track the activities and funds of the organization. DAOs allow anyone to join and participate in the decision-making process, without the need for intermedaries or authorities. 💯..... Nice yeah? 😉 

  

  

## How Does BUNNDAO work?  

- Anyone can join BUNNDAO by stacking a minimum amount of our tokens, staking our tokens grant voting rights and access to the DAO treasury. 💰 

-Anyone can propose a social imapct project to BUNNDAO by submitting a proposal that includes the project description, budget, timeline, and milestones. Proposals are reviewed and voted on by the DAO members. 🗳️ 

- If a proposal is approved, the project receives funding from the DAO treasury in installments, based on the completion of the milestones. The project progress is monitored and verified by the DAO members. 📈 

-  If a project is successful, the project team and the DAO members share the rewards, which can be in the form of social impact, recognition, or revenue. 🎁 

 

## Challanges Encountered  

Somtochukwu: 

Data type conversion: when developing the front End, (website) I faced difficulties such as being able to call functions with the right parameters and data type, the app almost broke because of that. I was able to manipulate my way through at the end. 

Smart contract development: developing the smart contracts was never an easy job, encoding function signature for both delegate and external was like hell. I figured it out though. 

I actually faced a lot of challenges but right now am happy that the dAPP is ready, that is why i can only remember a few challenges 

## Problems its solved  

Somtochukwu 

Being able to convert inputs and outputs into the right data type made the app function as expected  

Encoding external function calls gave me the ability to invoke another contract, hence, implementing decisions
